             This fixture tests marshalling of Tao.Ode functions using dMatrix3 as a parameter.
             dMatrix3 does not marshall correctly itself for some reason, so until this is corrected,
             dMatrix3 is passed to ODE as an array and overloaded functions are provided to retain
             compatibility with the ODE API.
            
             Strangely enough, dMatrix3 marshalling in the reverse direction (ie. from ODE) seems to work.

            Test to verify that dMatrix3 is correctly marshalled when *returning* data
            from an ODE call.
